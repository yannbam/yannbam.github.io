# Delta Summary: Most Recent Changes

## Added Cryptographic Algorithms Monologue

### API/Interface Changes
- Added new monologue file: `cryptographic_algorithms_party.txt`
- Updated website navigation to include the new monologue
- Updated CLAUDE.md with documentation of the new content

### Behavioral Changes
- Website now displays cryptographic algorithms content
- New creative content exploring security concepts through personification

### Motivation
This addition expands the project's coverage of security-focused technical topics, presenting cryptographic concepts in an accessible, engaging format through personification. The security gala setting provides a natural framework for exploring the relationships, strengths, and weaknesses of different cryptographic approaches.

## Added Quantum Computing Monologue

### API/Interface Changes
- Added new monologue file: `quantum_computing_concepts.txt`
- Updated website navigation to include the new monologue

### Behavioral Changes
- Website now displays quantum computing concepts content
- New entry in categories.md tracking the quantum computing topic

### Motivation
The addition of the quantum computing monologue expands the project's coverage of complex technical topics, adding a new domain that contrasts with the previously software-focused monologues.

## Claude Self-Documentation Updates

### API/Interface Changes
- Updated CLAUDE.md with comprehensive project history
- Added detailed documentation of character creation process

### Behavioral Changes
- More detailed tracking of project evolution
- Better documentation of decision processes for creative writing

### Motivation
Self-documentation provides insights into Claude's process for creating personified technical concepts, making it easier to maintain consistency across different monologues and for future Claude instances to understand the project context.

## Website Rollback

### API/Interface Changes
- Removed chat functionality from website
- Reverted to simpler website structure

### Behavioral Changes
- Website no longer provides interactive chat capabilities
- Focus returned to monologue display

### Motivation
